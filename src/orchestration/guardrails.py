"""Deterministic guardrails for the Bracket planner-supervisor.

These precondition wrappers enforce all safety invariants BEFORE any tool executes.
tinyagent will run whatever the planner requests — these wrappers are the safety net.

Invariants enforced here:
1. Planner cannot emit safety_posture itself (only emit_posture tool can)
2. Planner cannot skip/reorder safety guards (gate → extract → evidence → estimate → confidence → policy → posture)
3. Confidence is always deterministic (never from LLM)
4. Only persist_confirmed (with confirmed=True) persists; inferred bands never do
5. High-severity → sync step-up (enforced in runner.py)
6. Iteration cap → safe default posture (fail closed)
