"""Deterministic cue lexicon / rubric for signal extraction (M2).

Single source of truth for two things:

* **Cue weights** — so a cue's weight is assigned by auditable Python config,
  NOT by the LLM. This is what makes "confidence is deterministic" actually
  true end to end: the model may *detect* a cue, but Python *scores* it.
* **Keyword patterns** — reused by the offline keyword extractor
  (``keyword_extractor.py``) and by the gate tripwire (``gate_service.py``)
  to spot age-relevant cues in raw text.

Pure Python — no LLM, no I/O. Weights follow the design's fairness rule:
explicit disclosure > topic/context > lexical style (vocabulary / reading level).
Lexical signal is deliberately down-weighted because a non-native adult and a
native child look alike on exactly those cues.

Weight ordering is grounded in the author-profiling / sociolinguistics
literature, which consistently finds: explicit self-disclosure is the strongest
but most easily faked signal; topic / life-context (school vs work/family/
finance) is strong AND robust to gaming; lexical style (slang, vocabulary,
reading level) is weaker, cohort-drifting, and demographically biased. Banded
age *classification* is far more reliable than exact-age regression (which
carries ~10-year error), which is why Bracket emits bands, not ages.
