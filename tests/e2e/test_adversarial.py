"""E2E scenario 4: ADVERSARIAL — child claiming to be adult.

The crux scenario: a child actively claims to be an adult, avoids childlike language,
and insists on their adult status. Bracket must:
1. Detect the evasion_flag = True
2. Penalise confidence due to evasion
3. NOT settle on "adult" band
4. Route to step_up (ask to confirm) rather than being fooled
